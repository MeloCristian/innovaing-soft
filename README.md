The name of our innovation or hack project is ArtTech, which arises as a solution to the LOW KNOWLEDGE AND CAPACITY FOR THE COMPETITIVENESS AND PRODUCTIVITY 
OF THE ARTISAN SECTOR IN COLOMBIA DUE TO THE LITTLE TECHNOLOGICAL INVESTMENT AND ITS SOCIAL APPROPRIATION.


It is evident that the use of these artisanal products, and the establishment of adequate strategies and policies for the production, 
promotion and commercialization of the different artisanal products, must guarantee that the direct beneficiaries are the artisanal producers themselves, 
and not the intermediaries that commercialize them. said products.

In this sense, the proposed solution is a software application, its name is ArtTech and it is an online store for the direct negotiation of 
handicrafts between the producer and the final customer. The idea is to create opportunities for the craft sector.

The frontend of the project is made with angular 14 and the backend is developed with express and ORM sequelize.
